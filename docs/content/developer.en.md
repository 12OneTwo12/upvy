## 👋 Hello

I'm the solo developer behind Upvy. This project started with the vision of **"Turn Scroll Time into Growth Time"**.

---

## 🎯 Why Upvy?

TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts... We spend dozens of minutes to hours scrolling through short-form content every day. It's fun, but afterward, we often think, "I wasted time again."

**"What if we could keep the fun of short-form content while making that time contribute to personal growth?"**

This question led to Upvy. I wanted to provide interesting insights instead of rigid education, and natural growth instead of burdensome learning.

## 💭 Development Story

Upvy is a solo project where I handle everything from planning and design to development and operations.

At first, I wondered, "Can I really build an app by myself?" But with the help of AI tools like Claude Code and Gemini, I implemented it step by step. Of course, I make all the core design decisions myself, but AI has been a great development partner.

What I've learned from building this app is that "there's no perfect app." I believe it's more important to continuously improve based on feedback from users like you
